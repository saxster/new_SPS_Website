    "snippet": "79 Accesses The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in warfare is a topic of interest for not only military applications but also international policy and governance. Notable AI technology applications towards military equipment include drone swarms and autonomous vehicles, which have since been referred to as autonomous weapons. The use of lethal autonomous weapons has been explicitly called out and discussed in many international forums, but there has not been much formal progress in completely banning such technology. In discussing AI and global threats, AI in warfare features prominently and raises issues based on human rights and humanitarian considerations. This paper serves as an attempt to bring attention to the use of AI in military applications and related security implications. The deployment of new technology to avoid military personnel risking their lives on the battlefield is not new. AI and autonomous weapons are a result of this, as well as an upgrade in mismatches such as speed and accuracy over human operation. However, the deployment of machines raises issues of accountability, responsibility, and, of course, uncertainty, error, and unintended damage. AI technology does not yet equate to human levels of reasoning and judgment, and cannot exceed human emotional, moral, and ethical deliberations. In addition, operational difficulties such as environmental incompatibility will only worsen the situation. The rise of autonomous weapons represents a way in which AI can be used to harm the world. As an emerging technology, AI has the potential to contribute to mitigating these and other global threats. However, strong governance will need to be created and enforced so that AI is used instead as a force for good. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

They lie at the heart of today\u2019s critical infrastructure. CPSs are currently one of the most targeted systems of adversarial actors operating in the cyber domain. Cyber-physical and cyber-operational attacks on critical infrastructures via attacks on CPSs have the potential to damage physical infrastructure assets and have widespread consequences for national security as well as the society. We analyzed 427 publicly reported cyber-physical and cyber-operational attacks conducted against critical infrastructures globally between January 1, 1992, and July 9, 2021. We find that of the attacks that can be attributed to an actor type, state actors (including state-affiliated and state-supported actors) were found to be the predominant actors that conduct cyber-physical attacks while state and non-state actors occupied approximately same ratio of attacks for cyber-operational attacks. We also find espionage to be the most statistically significant motivation for the state actors to conduct cyber-physical and/or cyber-operational attacks. Additionally, we find rivalry between the attacker and the target to be the most statistically significant international security relevant variable. Finally, we provide an assessment of the implications of cyber-physical and cyber-operational attacks on critical infrastructure in the contexts of current and future irregular warfare and great power competition.

    "snippet": "6 Pages Posted: 11 Jul 2024 University of Muenster Date Written: July 03, 2024 Three landmark criminal laws, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhinayam (BSA), came into effect on July 1, 2024, replacing three outdated British-era laws in India. The new laws aim to transform India's criminal justice system and provide a more efficient and effective framework for addressing crime. This article will delve into the key features of the BNS, which seeks to replace the century-old Indian Penal Code (IPC). The BNS perpetuates the expansion of state and police powers, retains offenses rooted in outdated moral standards, and exacerbates the retributive system through the introduction of broad and ambiguously defined offenses. It is contended that the legislation appears to be drafted with the primary objective of creating an illusion of moving beyond colonial legacies in terms of outdated colonial laws, while concurrently promoting a nationalist agenda aimed at fostering patriotic sentiments among the masses.

The book starts by tracing the development of criminal law in India, from the ancient and medieval periods, through the colonial era, to post-independence developments, culminating in the recent 2023 reforms. It provides a detailed look at the structure and classification of offenses under the new code, including jurisdictional aspects and the applicability of the law in various cases such as corporate crimes and international jurisdiction. In-depth sections are devoted to general exceptions in criminal liability, defining legal defenses such as mistake of fact, judicial acts, and absence of criminal intent. The book also explores inchoate crimes like abetment, conspiracy, and attempt, as well as offenses against the human body, women, and property, detailing punishments and legal defenses for each. Key topics such as dowry death, sexual harassment, kidnapping, robbery, and organized crime are thoroughly examined. Additionally, the text addresses offenses against public tranquility, state security, and national integrity, offering insights into laws surrounding sedition, waging war, and the protection of public officials. With sections dedicated to various forms of criminal trespass, rioting, and unlawful assembly, this book serves as a crucial reference for understanding the scope of criminal law in modern India, including the legal nuances, punishments, and defenses under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023.

    "snippet": "One of the most studied defense reactions of plants against microbial pathogens is the hypersensitive response (HR). The HR is a complex multicellular process that involves programmed cell death at the site of infection. A standard method to quantify plant defense and the HR is to measure the release of cellular electrolytes into water after infiltration with pathogenic bacteria. In this type of experiment, the bacteria are typically delivered into the plant tissue through syringe infiltration. Here we report the development of a vacuum infiltration protocol that allows multiple plant lines to be infiltrated simultaneously and assayed for defense responses. Vacuum infiltration did not induce more wounding response in Arabidopsis leaf tissue than syringe inoculation, whereas throughput and reproducibility were improved. The method was used to study HR-induced electrolyte loss after treatment with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 harboring the effector AvrRpm1, AvrRpt2 or AvrRps4. Specifically, the influence of bacterial titer on AvrRpm1-induced HR was investigated. Not only the amplitude, but also the timing of the maximum rate of the HR reaction was found to be dose-dependent. Finally, using vacuum infiltration, we were able quantify induction of phospholipase D activity after AvrRpm1 recognition in leaves labeled with 33 PO 4 . Phytopathogenic microorganisms are omnipresent in nature and pose a constant threat to plants. Despite this, plants rarely become infected and develop disease; a multi-layered innate immune system protects them from most pathogens. Plants can perceive microbes through pattern recognition receptors that recognizes conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP), leading to activation of defense mechanisms and MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) ( Dodds & Rathjen, 2010 ). Consequently, pathogens have evolved several strategies which enable them to break plant defense and proliferate. The pathogens may for example secrete e",

Barcode sequences allow each primary probe to be amplified as part of a pool of primary probes that target a chromosome (chromosome barcode), 3 Mb subsection of chromosome (3 Mb barcode), or 500 kb subsection of chromosome (500 kb barcode). Bridge oligos and Detection oligos (arrows) are used to recognize and illuminate primary probes. Note: primary oligos contain an additional barcode not used in this work (brown). The barcode is specific to each 500 kb segment and could be used to increase detection efficiencies of 500 kb DNA FISH by allowing an addition detection oligo to be incorporated during the detection phase of DNA FISH.

State-of-the-art methods use the projection of the gray-scale face image into a Linear Discriminant subspace as input of a classifier such as Support Vector Machines or Multi-layer Perceptrons. Unfortunately, these classifiers involve thousands of parameters that are difficult to store on a smart-card for instance. Recently, boosting algorithms has emerged to boost the performance of simple (weak) classifiers by combining them iteratively. The famous AdaBoost algorithm have been proposed for object detection and applied successfully to face detection. In this paper, we investigate the use of AdaBoost for face authentication to boost weak classifiers based simply on pixel values. The proposed approach is tested on a benchmark database, namely XM2VTS. Results show that boosting only hundreds of classifiers achieved near state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms similar work on face authentication using boosting algorithms on the same database.

    "snippet": "Part of the book series: Lecture Notes in Computer Science ((LNCS,volume 2091)) Included in the following conference series: 1791 Accesses 31 Citations In this paper, a hybrid person authentication prototype integrating multiple biometric devices is presented. This prototype is based on several levels of abstractions: data representations, vectors and classifiers. Frontal face and text-dependent voice biometrics are chosen to authenticate a user. For each of the biometric feature, an extractor, a classifier and a simple negotiation scheme have been designed. An extractor is made up of a sequence of operators which themselves are made up of signal processing and image processing algorithms. The face information is extracted using moments and the short speech information is extracted using wavelets. The extracted information, called vectors, is classified using two separate multi-layer perceptrons. The results are combined using a simple logical negotiation scheme. The prototype has been tested and evaluated on real-life databases. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

    "snippet": "Menu links Published online by Cambridge University Press: 05 September 2012 Over the course of the twentieth century, comparative political scientists' core questions have changed very little. From Weber and Gramsci to Almond, Verba, and Skocpol, their concerns have centered on why people obey and on what sorts of structures and cultures facilitate obedience and conformist behavior. The elements that political scientists have singled out for investigation as the key to understanding obedience and conformity have included the usual suspects: parliaments, bureaucracies, governmental leadership, courts and law, and police and military. These form the constituent parts and parameters of that complex and somewhat elusive structure called the modern state \u2013 the mountain that all political scientists sooner or later must climb. In the pages ahead, I will make several central points. First, in the next section, I will argue that, despite the assault on the state from a number of directions, it will remain central to the study of comparative politics well into the twenty-first century. Second, in part due to the overwhelming influence of Weber on the study of the state, various perspectives \u2013 culturalist, rationalist, and institutionalist \u2013 have tended to isolate it as a subject of study, peering into its innards and poring over its organization in order to understand how it succeeds in gaining obedience and conformity from its population. This sort of analytic isolation of the state, I will claim, has led to a mystification of its capabilities and power. Loading...

    "snippet": "53 Accesses Explore all metrics Visible light communication is vital in industrial applications, particularly for its high energy efficiency, high data transmission speeds that outperform other systems, and low interference. Given the limited research on visible light communication applications in industrial fields, improving lighting and communication efficiency still requires further study. Accordingly, this paper presents two new models for distributing lighting units within warehouses of varying dimensions and heights, each model providing lighting first, followed by communication. A new proposed model for industrial warehouses was designed, based on different lengths, widths, semi-angles at half-power (SAAHP), and height levels at different semi-angles, for metrics such as received power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER). The study\u2019s findings showed that the warehouse evenly distributes both the received power and the illumination. The dimensions of the warehouse were calculated using MATLAB simulations. This study can be implemented in industrial warehouses and conference rooms. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.
