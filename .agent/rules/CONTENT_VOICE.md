## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Authoritative
We state facts, not guesses. We cite sources, not rumours.
- Use active voice by default
- Attribute claims to named sources
- Avoid hedging ("may", "might", "could potentially")

### 2. Professional
We speak as experts to experts.
- No slang, no emojis (except in UI signals)
- No casual contractions in formal content (can't → cannot)
- Formal but not stiff

### 3. Reassuring
Security is about enabling safety, not fear-mongering.
- Convey stability and control
- Focus on solutions, not just problems
- Acknowledge risks without sensationalising

### 4. Precise
Numbers speak louder than adjectives.
- "147 incidents in Q3 2025" not "many incidents"
- "₹5-15 lakh" not "significant investment"
- "On 12 January 2026" not "recently"
