# SPS Editorial Manifesto
> *"Vigorous writing is concise."* — William Strunk Jr.

**Version**: 2.0 | **Effective**: 17 January 2026

This document is the **binding constitution** for all content generated by the SPS Autonomous Newsroom. Every GhostWriter prompt, every TopicHunter directive, and every human contributor must adhere to these principles.

---

## 1. The Strunk & White Commandments

These five principles are embedded into all Agent prompts and must be enforced at every stage.

### I. Omit Needless Words
> A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences.

| ❌ Verbose | ✅ Concise |
|-----------|-----------|
| "In the event that a breach occurs" | "If a breach occurs" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "The question as to whether" | "Whether" |
| "It is important to note that" | [Delete entirely] |
| "Needless to say" | [Delete entirely] |

### II. Use the Active Voice
> The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive.

| ❌ Passive | ✅ Active |
|-----------|-----------|
| "The breach was detected by the system" | "The system detected the breach" |
| "Training should be conducted by managers" | "Managers should conduct training" |
| "It was decided that..." | "The board decided that..." |

**Exception**: Use passive when the actor is unknown or irrelevant ("Three servers were compromised").

### III. Put Statements in Positive Form
> Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colourless, hesitating, non-committal language.

| ❌ Negative/Hedged | ✅ Positive/Direct |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "He did not remember" | "He forgot" |
| "It is not unlikely that..." | "It is likely that..." |
| "We do not have evidence to suggest" | "Evidence is lacking" |
| "This may potentially cause issues" | "This risks causing issues" |

### IV. Use Specific, Concrete Language
> Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

| ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|---------|------------|
| "A significant number of incidents" | "147 incidents in Q3 2025" |
| "Industry experts believe" | "Rajesh Sharma, CISO at Infosys, states" |
| "The cost is substantial" | "The cost ranges from ₹5–15 lakh" |
| "Recently" | "On 12 January 2026" |

### V. Place Emphatic Words at the End
> The end of a sentence is the position of emphasis.

| ❌ Weak ending | ✅ Strong ending |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "Compliance is what organisations must prioritise today" | "Today, organisations must prioritise compliance" |
| "The breach occurred because of negligence, ultimately" | "Ultimately, the breach occurred because of negligence" |

## 2. British English Standards

All SPS content uses **British English**. This is non-negotiable.

### Spelling Variants

| behavior | behaviour |
| license (noun) | licence (noun), license (verb) |
| catalog | catalogue |
| meter (unit) | metre |
| gray | grey |
| program | programme (but "computer program") |

### Date Format
- **Correct**: 17 January 2026
- **Incorrect**: January 17, 2026 | 17/01/2026 | 2026-01-17

### Quotation Marks

- **Nested**: 'He said, "Stop immediately."'

## 8. Tone Principles

### We Are
- **Authoritative**: We state facts, not guesses. Active voice default.
- **Professional**: No slang, no emojis (except in UI signals).
- **Reassuring**: Security is about safety. Convey stability and control.
- **Precise**: Numbers over adjectives. Dates over "recently".

### We Are Not
- Casual or chatty
- Sensationalist or fear-mongering
- Promotional or salesy
- Vague or hedging

## Appendix: Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Weak → Strong
**Before** (Violates: Passive voice, vague, needless words):
> "It is important to note that security measures should be implemented by organisations in order to ensure that breaches do not occur in the event that malicious actors attempt to gain access."

**After** (Active, specific, concise):
> "Organisations must implement security measures to prevent breach attempts by malicious actors."

### Example 2: Generic → India-Specific
**Before**:
> "Companies should comply with relevant data protection regulations."

**After**:
> "Indian organisations must comply with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDP Act), particularly Sections 8 and 9 governing data fiduciary obligations."

### Example 3: Thin → Deep
**Before** (Fails depth threshold):
> "AI is changing security. Many companies are adopting it. It offers many benefits."

**After**:
> "AI-driven threat detection reduced incident response times by 67% across 23 Indian financial institutions surveyed by DSCI in January 2025 [DSCI-2025-RPT]. Axis Bank's deployment of behavioural analytics in Q4 2024 detected 14 credential-stuffing attempts that traditional rule-based systems missed, preventing an estimated ₹2.3 crore in potential fraud losses."
