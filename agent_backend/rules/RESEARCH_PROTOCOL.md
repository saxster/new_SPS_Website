# SPS Research Protocol
> *"The standard of civilised debate"* — The Economist

**Version**: 1.0 | **Effective**: 17 January 2026

This protocol defines the **minimum research depth** required before any article enters the writing stage. GhostWriter's research phase must satisfy these requirements.

---

## 1. Research Categories

Every article must gather intelligence across **six mandatory categories**:

### Category A: Foundational Facts (Minimum 10 points)
The bedrock knowledge that establishes authority:
- Key definitions and industry terminology
- Current state of the technology/practice
- Market size and growth projections (India-specific)
- Historical context (origin, evolution)
- Key players and stakeholders

**Quality Standard**: Each fact must be attributable to a specific source.

### Category B: Statistics & Data (Minimum 5 data points)
Quantitative evidence that substantiates claims:
- Industry surveys and reports
- Government statistics
- Academic research findings
- Market research data
- Performance benchmarks

**Quality Standard**: 
- Each statistic must include source and publication year
- Prefer India-specific data; if unavailable, use global with contextualisation
- Include trend data (year-over-year comparisons) where available

### Category C: Regulatory Landscape (Minimum 3 regulations)
Legal and compliance framework:
- Central Acts with Section numbers
- Subordinate rules and notifications
- State-level variations (if applicable)
- Upcoming regulatory changes
- Enforcement patterns and penalties

**Quality Standard**:
- Cite specific sections, not just Act names
- Include effective dates
- Note recent amendments

### Category D: Expert Perspectives (Minimum 2 sources)
Authoritative voices that validate analysis:
- Named individuals with full credentials
- Direct quotes where available
- Contrarian or dissenting viewpoints
- Academic commentary

**Quality Standard**:
- Full name + Designation + Organisation
- Never use "industry experts say" or "analysts believe"
- Balance perspectives (not just cheerleaders)

### Category E: Case Studies (Minimum 2 examples)
Real-world implementations that ground theory:
- India-specific implementations preferred
- Both success stories and cautionary tales
- Timeline and measurable outcomes
- Lessons learned

**Quality Standard**:
- Named organisations (not "a major bank")
- Specific dates or time periods
- Quantifiable results where possible

### Category F: Cost Analysis (Mandatory)
Financial implications for Indian context:
- INR cost ranges for different scales
- Hidden costs and ongoing expenses
- ROI benchmarks or payback periods
- Comparison with alternatives

**Quality Standard**:
- Use lakh/crore notation
- Specify what the cost covers
- Date the estimate (costs change)

## 2. Source Hierarchy

Not all sources are equal. Prioritise as follows:

### Tier 1: Primary Sources (Highest Authority)
- Government gazettes and official circulars
- Court judgments (Supreme Court, High Courts)
- Regulatory body notifications (RBI, SEBI, MeitY, MHA)
- Official annual reports
- Press releases from principals

### Tier 2: Institutional Sources (High Authority)
- Industry body publications (FICCI, CII, NASSCOM, DSCI)
- Academic journals (peer-reviewed)
- Think tank reports (Brookings, ORF, IDFC Institute)
- International standards bodies (ISO, NIST, ENISA)

### Tier 3: Quality Media (Moderate Authority)
- Quality newspapers (The Hindu, Mint, Economic Times, TOI)
- Specialist publications (CSO Online, SecurityWeek)
- Wire services (PTI, Reuters, AFP)
- Respected international media (FT, Economist, NYT)

### Tier 4: Secondary Sources (Use with Attribution)
- Industry white papers (note potential bias)
- Vendor-sponsored research (explicitly disclose)
- Conference presentations
- LinkedIn posts from verified experts

### Tier 5: Unusable Sources (Never Cite)
- Anonymous blogs or forums
- Wikipedia (may use for initial orientation only)
- Social media posts (unless from verified official accounts)
- AI-generated summaries without primary verification
- "Content farms" or SEO-optimised listicles

## 3. India Context Requirements

### Mandatory Indian Elements
Every article must demonstrate **genuine** Indian relevance:

| Requirement | Minimum | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| Indian laws/regulations | 2 | DPDP Act 2023 Section 8(1); IT Act 2000 Section 43A |
| Indian case study | 1 | "HDFC Bank's 2024 biometric authentication rollout" |
| INR cost estimate | 1 | "₹5-15 lakh for SME implementation" |
| Indian regulatory body | 1 | "As per CERT-In advisory of March 2025" |

### Contextualisation of Global Data
When using international statistics, always contextualise:

**❌ Wrong**:
> "Global ransomware damages reached $20 billion in 2024."

**✅ Right**:
> "Global ransomware damages reached $20 billion in 2024 (approximately ₹1.67 lakh crore). DSCI estimates Indian organisations accounted for 9% of Asia-Pacific incidents, translating to roughly ₹15,000 crore in domestic exposure."
