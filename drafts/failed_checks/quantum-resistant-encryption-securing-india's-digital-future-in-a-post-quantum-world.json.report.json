  "critique": "The article provides a good overview of quantum-resistant encryption and its potential importance for India's digital future. However, it falls short in providing specific, actionable information. The regulatory analysis is incomplete, and the cost estimate is too vague to be useful. Additionally, the article does not provide enough evidence to support its claims about the importance of quantum-resistant encryption. In its current form, the article is not sufficiently rigorous or detailed to be a reliable guide for organizations considering implementing quantum-resistant encryption."
