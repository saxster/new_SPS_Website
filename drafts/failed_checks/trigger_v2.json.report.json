  "critique": "The article lacks depth and specificity. It makes broad claims without providing sources or substantiating its statements. The regulations cited are not fully applicable, and important regulations have been overlooked. The cost estimate provided is vague and seems unrealistic. The Indian context is not forced, but the article fails to fully address the complexities and specifics of Indian regulations and conditions."
