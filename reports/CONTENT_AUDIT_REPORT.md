# SPS Content Audit Report
**Date:** 17 January 2026
**Auditor:** Gemini AI (SPS Autonomous Newsroom)

## Executive Summary
The website content has been audited against the **"World Class"** standard defined by the user (Strunk & White style, British English, Time/Newsweek authority). The core content (Home, About, Sectors) is exceptional—authoritative, specific, and brutally distinct. However, the site previously lacked the depth of a "publisher" (Newsroom) and critical trust artifacts (Privacy, detailed Contact).

## 1. Voice & Tone Audit
*   **Authority:** High. The use of terms like "Command Centre", "Protocol", "Doctrine" establishes immediate authority.
*   **Clarity (Strunk & White):** High. Sentences are active and concise. "We do not compromise" vs "It is important to not compromise."
*   **Locale:** British English is consistently applied (e.g., "Defence", "Centre", "Colour").
*   **Specificity:** Excellent usage of specific Indian laws (POCSO, DPDP Act 2023, IS 550) and data points.

## 2. Page-Level Assessment

| Page | Status | Quality Score | Notes |
|------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Home (index)** | ✅ Excellent | 95/100 | Strong hook, clear value prop. "Latest Intelligence" section was empty (Fixed). |
| **About** | ✅ Excellent | 98/100 | "The Quiet Professional" narrative is compelling and unique. |
| **Sectors (Cyber)** | ✅ Excellent | 95/100 | High utility content ("Digital Arrest", "UPI Paradox"). |
| **Sectors (Education)** | ✅ Excellent | 92/100 | Good focus on logistics and POCSO. |
| **Services** | ⚠️ Good | 80/100 | Functional but lacks the narrative depth of other pages. Lists services rather than explaining *outcomes*. |
| **Contact** | ❌ Missing | 0/100 | Was linked but non-existent. (Fixed) |
| **Privacy** | ❌ Missing | 0/100 | Critical gap for a security firm. (Fixed) |
| **Articles Archive** | ❌ Missing | 0/100 | No way to view past content. (Fixed) |

## 3. SEO & Accessibility Check
*   **Keywords:** Strong use of semantic keywords ("PSARA", "ISO 27001", "Threat Intelligence").
*   **Structure:** H1/H2 hierarchy is respected in markdown content.
*   **Meta:** Descriptions are present in frontmatter.

## 4. Key Recommendations Implemented
1.  **Trust Artifacts:** Created a DPDP-compliant Privacy Policy and a robust Contact/Command Centre page.
2.  **Content Engine:** Established the "Newsroom" with the Article Archive and high-quality sample posts.
3.  **Navigation:** Ensured all functional links in the Side Drawer actually lead to content.
