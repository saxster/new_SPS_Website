## 1. Introduction: Why BNS matters for security

On 1 July 2024, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) replaced the Indian Penal Code (IPC) of 1860. [1]

For security professionals, this matters because:
- **Training materials need updating**: All references to IPC sections must change to BNS
- **Reports and documentation**: FIRs and incident reports use new section numbers
- **Legal understanding**: Provisions have been reorganised and some definitions changed
- **Court testimony**: Witnesses must cite correct law

This guide provides security-relevant BNS provisions with practical applications.

## 2. The new criminal law framework (BNS, BNSS, BSA)

Three new laws replaced the colonial-era criminal codes:

| Old Law | New Law | Effective Date | Purpose |
|---------|---------|----------------|---------|
| Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) | Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS) | 1 July 2024 | Defines crimes and punishments |
| Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) | Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS) | 1 July 2024 | Procedures for investigation, trial |
| Indian Evidence Act, 1872 | Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (BSA) | 1 July 2024 | Rules of evidence |

**Key changes in BNS**:
- 358 sections (vs 511 in IPC) — consolidated and reorganised
- New offences: organised crime, terrorism (previously in special laws)
- Enhanced penalties for certain offences against women and children
- Community service as punishment option for minor offences

**What remains similar**:
- Core definitions of theft, robbery, assault remain substantially unchanged
- Private defence provisions carried forward with same principles
- Burden of proof and presumptions similar

## 3. Property offences: Theft, robbery, burglary

### 3.1. Theft (BNS Section 303)
Theft is the most common offence a security guard encounters. It is defined as the dishonest taking of moveable property out of the possession of any person without their consent. The key elements are "dishonest intention" and "moving" the object. Even moving a laptop from a desk to a bag (without leaving the room) constitutes theft if the intent is to steal.
*   **Security Action**: If a theft is witnessed, the guard must not touch the object (evidence) but should secure the area and review CCTV to confirm the identity of the suspect.

### 3.2. Robbery vs. Theft (The Force Factor)
Robbery (Section 309) is an aggravated form of theft. Theft becomes Robbery when the offender, in order to commit the theft or carry away the loot, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause death, hurt, or wrongful restraint.
*   **Critical Distinction**: If a thief snatches a purse and pushes the victim (causing hurt), it is Robbery. If they pick a pocket without the victim noticing, it is Theft. This distinction changes the police response priority and the penalties (3 years for theft vs. 10 years for robbery).

### 3.3. Dacoity (The "Gang" Clause)
Dacoity (Section 310) is technically robbery committed by **five or more persons** conjointly. The law treats this as a heinous crime against the state's order.
*   **Security Implication**: A group of 5 armed men entering a warehouse is a Dacoity. This situation requires immediate police intervention (Dial 100/112). Private security should prioritize "Observe and Report" and life safety over asset protection, as dacoits are presumed to be lethal.

### 3.4. Criminal Trespass and House-Breaking
Trespass (Section 329) involves entering property with the intent to commit an offence or intimidate the possessor. "House-breaking" (Section 331) is a specific form of trespass that involves "violent entry"—breaking a lock, scaling a wall, or entering through a window.
*   **The "Lurking" Factor**: Section 330 defines "Lurking House-Trespass"—hiding inside a building to commit a crime. This is why "Closing Patrols" (checking toilets and closets) are a critical SOP for security guards at the end of a shift.

## 7. Citizen's arrest: Powers and limitations

### 7.1. The Legal Basis (BNSS Section 43)
Under the new Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (Section 43), any private person (including a security guard) may arrest any person who, **in their presence**, commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence. The law empowers the citizen to "arrest" (restrain) the offender and "without unnecessary delay" hand them over to a police officer.

### 7.2. The "In Presence" Requirement
This is the most critical limitation. A guard cannot arrest someone on suspicion or based on a report from yesterday. They must *see* the crime happening (e.g., stabbing, robbery in progress). If a guard detains a person because "he looks suspicious," the guard can be charged with "Wrongful Confinement" (BNS Section 127).

### 7.3. Use of Force during Citizen's Arrest
The force used to effect the arrest must be "Necessary and Proportionate." You can hold the offender's arm or block their exit. You cannot beat them, tie them to a pole, or humiliate them. The "Mob Justice" often seen in India is illegal. Once the person is restrained, the guard's duty is to protect the offender from the public until the police arrive.

### 7.4. The Handover Protocol
Upon arresting a suspect, the security supervisor must immediately call the police. When the police arrive, the guard must provide a written statement of what they witnessed. The suspect must be physically handed over to the police custody along with any seized property (e.g., the knife or stolen bag). Security should never interrogate the suspect; that is the police's job.

## 8. What security guards CANNOT do

### Cannot arrest on suspicion
Unless the offence was witnessed directly, there is no power to arrest.

### Cannot search persons
Only police have search powers. Security can request voluntary bag check; refusal is not grounds for arrest.

### Cannot use handcuffs
Use of handcuffs by private security is generally prohibited unless in immediate self-defence.

### Cannot detain for investigation
"Holding for questioning" is wrongful confinement. Handover to police or release.

### Cannot use force to recover property
If a thief has escaped with property, pursuing and using force to recover is risky — better to observe and report.

### Cannot act as vigilantes
Mob justice, "teaching a lesson," or punishing offenders is illegal regardless of provocation.

### Cannot issue fines
Only courts can impose fines. "Pay ₹500 or we call police" is extortion.

## 9. Use of force jurisprudence

Indian courts have established principles for evaluating use of force:

### Proportionality
Force must be proportionate to the threat. Using a lathi against an unarmed shoplifter is likely excessive.

### Necessity
Force is justified only when no other option exists. If you can retreat safely, force may not be justified.

### Immediacy
Force is justified only during the threat. Once the attacker has fled, pursuit with force is questionable.

### Reasonableness
Judged from the perspective of a reasonable person in the same circumstances, not with hindsight.

### Key cases

**Puran Singh v. State of Punjab (1975)**:
- Right of private defence is not weighed in golden scales
- A person under attack cannot be expected to "modulate" force precisely

**Vidhya Singh v. State of MP (1971)**:
- Self-defence right is to repel attack, not to take revenge
- Once danger passes, continued attack is criminal

**Yogendra Morarji v. State of Gujarat (1980)**:
- Even if defence was technically excessive, courts may grant benefit of doubt
- But premeditated or revengeful acts are not protected

## 11. Practical scenarios

### Scenario 1: Shoplifter caught on camera but not witnessed

**Situation**: CCTV shows person pocketing item. Guard approaches at exit.

**Legal position**: Guard did not witness the offence. No power to arrest.

**Recommended action**:
1. Politely request the person to wait
2. Show CCTV footage
3. Request voluntary return of item
4. If refused, note description and call police
5. Do not physically restrain

### Scenario 2: Trespasser refuses to leave

**Situation**: Person enters private property and refuses to leave when asked.

**Legal position**: Criminal trespass under BNS 329. Cognizable and non-bailable if with intent to commit offence.

**Recommended action**:
1. Issue verbal warning (documented)
2. If refusal, call police
3. Minimum force to prevent further entry
4. Do not drag out — wait for police

### Scenario 3: Armed robber demands cash

**Situation**: Person with knife demands cash from counter.

**Legal position**: Robbery (BNS 309). Private defence up to causing death may be justified.

**Recommended action**:
1. If unarmed, comply with demands (life > property)
2. If armed and trained, assess feasibility of response
3. Silent alarm activation
4. Observe details for police report
5. Secure premises after robber leaves

### Scenario 4: Employee assaulted by visitor

**Situation**: Visitor punches employee in reception area.

2. Restrain attacker with minimum force
3. Call police immediately
4. Document injuries and witness statements
5. Hand attacker to police upon arrival
