## 1. What is an FIR and when is it required

**FIR (First Information Report)** is the first document registered by police when they receive information about a cognizable offence. It triggers the investigation process.

Under BNSS Section 173 (formerly CrPC Section 154):
- Any person can give information about a cognizable offence
- Police must reduce the information to writing
- The informant must sign the written document
- A free copy must be provided to the informant

**When FIR is required**:
- Theft, robbery, burglary at your premises
- Assault on employees or visitors
- Property damage (vandalism, mischief)
- Fraud or cheating
- Cybercrime (after reporting at cybercrime.gov.in)
- Any cognizable offence witnessed or suffered

**When FIR is NOT required**:
- Non-cognizable offences (minor offences requiring magistrate's order)
- Civil disputes (tenancy, contract, family matters)
- Matters already under litigation

## 2. Cognizable vs non-cognizable offences

### Cognizable offences (FIR required)
Police can arrest without warrant and investigate without court permission.

| Offence | BNS Section | Notes |

| Theft | 303 | Property offence |
| Robbery | 309 | Theft with force/threat |
| Dacoity | 310 | Robbery by 5+ persons |

| Assault causing hurt | 115 | Bodily injury caused |
| Grievous hurt | 115 | Serious injury |
| Criminal trespass | 329 | With intent to commit offence |
| Cheating | 318 | Fraud/deception for gain |
| Criminal breach of trust | 316 | Misappropriation by trustee |
| Mischief | 324 | Damage to property |

### Non-cognizable offences (NCR, not FIR)
Police need magistrate's permission to investigate.

| Offence | BNS Section | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Defamation | 356 | Reputation harm |
| Simple assault | 130 | Threat without injury |
| Criminal intimidation | 351 | Threats without action |

## 3. Documents to bring: The "FIR Kit"

### 3.1. Mandatory Identity and Address Proof
The Station House Officer (SHO) cannot register a complaint from a "ghost." You must provide a valid government ID (Aadhaar, Voter ID, Passport). If you are a tenant reporting a theft, bring your Lease Agreement to prove your locus standi (legal right) at the premises. For corporate representatives, a formal "Authorization Letter" on company letterhead is essential to prove you are acting on behalf of the entity.

### 3.2. The Written Complaint (Tehrir)
While you can give an oral statement, a written complaint (Tehrir) is superior. It prevents "Lost in Translation" errors where the police scribe might summarize or omit critical details. The complaint should be a chronological narrative: "On Date X, at Time Y, I observed Z." Avoid emotional language; stick to observable facts. If possible, have this drafted in the local state language (e.g., Marathi in Mumbai, Kannada in Bengaluru) to expedite the Station Diary entry.

### 3.3. Digital Evidence and Certification
If you have CCTV footage, do not just show it on your phone. Provide it on a USB drive or CD. Crucially, under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act (now Section 63 of BSA), electronic evidence is inadmissible without a certificate. Mention in your complaint that "Certificate under Section 63 BSA will be provided." This signals to the police that you understand the legal process and are a serious complainant.

## 4. FIR for theft at premises (Section 303 BNS)

### 4.1. Immediate Actions: Freezing the Scene
Before you go to the police station, you must preserve the "Crime Scene." Do not touch broken locks, do not clean up the mess, and do not allow guards to walk over the area. The forensic team (if dispatched) needs pristine fingerprints. Take high-resolution photos from multiple angles—wide shots for context and close-ups for specific damage (e.g., pry marks on the door).

### 4.2. Drafting the "List of Stolen Articles"
The police need specific values to categorize the theft. Create a detailed inventory: "Item Description, Make/Model, Serial Number, Estimated Value." Attach purchase invoices if available. This list is critical because if the police recover goods later, you can only claim them (Superdari) if they match the description in your FIR. Vague descriptions like "some jewelry" make recovery legally impossible.

### 4.3. Navigating the Police Station
When you arrive, ask for the "Duty Officer" or "PSO." Submit your written complaint and demand a "Received" stamp on a photocopy. This stamped copy is your proof that you reported the crime. If the police suggest a "NC" (Non-Cognizable) report instead of an FIR for theft, politely refuse. Theft is a Cognizable Offence (Section 303 BNS), and they are legally bound to register an FIR.

## 5. FIR for robbery or dacoity (Section 309/310 BNS)

### 5.1. The Legal Distinction: Numbers Matter
The difference between Robbery and Dacoity is purely numerical. If **5 or more persons** commit the robbery, it is legally "Dacoity" (Section 310 BNS), which carries a much harsher sentence (Life Imprisonment). When reporting, be precise about the number of attackers. If you saw 4 people entering and 1 driver waiting, that counts as 5. Accurate reporting ensures the charge sheet reflects the gravity of the crime.

### 5.2. Safety First: The "No Pursuit" Rule
During a robbery, the priority is life safety, not property defense. Do not chase armed robbers; they are often part of a larger gang with backup nearby. Once they leave, lock the premises to preserve evidence and call 112 immediately. The "Golden Hour" for catching robbers is the first 60 minutes; immediate police notification allows them to set up "Naka Bandi" (roadblocks) to intercept the getaway vehicle.

### 5.3. Medical Evidence (The MLC)
If anyone was pushed, slapped, or injured, they must go to a government hospital for a **Medico-Legal Certificate (MLC)**. This document is the only proof of "Hurt" or "Grievous Hurt" accepted by the court. Private hospital reports are valid, but a government MLC is harder for the defense to challenge. Do not skip this step even for minor injuries, as it escalates the crime from simple theft to "Robbery with Hurt," ensuring tougher bail conditions for the accused.
