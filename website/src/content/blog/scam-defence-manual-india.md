## 1. The scam landscape in India

India reported over ₹10,000 crore in cyber fraud losses in 2024, with UPI fraud, digital arrest scams, and investment fraud accounting for the majority. [1]

Scammers exploit:
- **Trust in authority**: Impersonating police, RBI, courts
- **Fear of consequences**: Arrest threats, account freezing
- **Urgency**: "Act now or face consequences"
- **Technical complexity**: Exploiting unfamiliarity with digital systems
- **Social pressure**: Public embarrassment, family shame

This manual covers recognition patterns and defence protocols for the most prevalent scams targeting Indians.

## 2. Digital arrest scam (fake police/CBI)

### How it works

1. **Initial contact**: Call or message claiming to be from CBI, Cyber Police, Narcotics Bureau, or Customs
2. **Fabricated crime**: "Your Aadhaar is linked to money laundering" or "Drugs found in parcel with your name"
3. **Video call demand**: Insist on video call showing fake police uniform and office setup
4. **Isolation**: "Don't tell anyone, this is confidential investigation"
5. **Digital arrest**: Force victim to stay on continuous video call, sometimes for days
6. **Payment demand**: "Pay fine/settlement/bail to clear your name"
7. **Escalation**: Threaten family members, show fake arrest warrants

### 2.2. Recognition patterns: How to spot the lie

#### The "Video Call" Anomaly
The most immediate red flag is the use of consumer video apps. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), and local police *never* conduct interrogations via WhatsApp, Skype, or Zoom. Official questioning legally requires a written summons (Section 41A CrPC/BNSS) delivered to your physical address, summoning you to a police station. If an officer appears on your phone screen demanding you turn on your camera, it is a scam 100% of the time.

#### The "Digital Arrest" Threat
Scammers invented the term "Digital Arrest" to terrify victims. In Indian law, there is no such concept. You are either arrested (physically taken into custody with a memo of arrest) or you are free. The demand to "stay on the line" or "keep your camera on" for hours is a psychological isolation tactic designed to prevent you from contacting legal counsel or family.

#### The "Secret Investigation" Ruse
Scammers insist on absolute secrecy, claiming that "national security" or "RBI regulations" prevent you from telling your family. This contradicts actual police procedure, where the first right of an arrested person is to inform a friend or relative. Secrecy is the scammer's shield; they fear your spouse or parent will break the spell of panic.

### 2.3. Defence protocol: Breaking the spell

#### Step 1: Terminate the connection
The moment you hear "money laundering," "drugs in parcel," or "Aadhaar misuse," hang up. Do not explain, do not apologize, and do not say goodbye. Ending the call breaks the psychological control the scammer is attempting to establish. They cannot arrest you through the phone, and they cannot magically appear at your house because they are likely operating from a call centre in a different country or state.

#### Step 2: Verify independently (The "Out-of-Band" check)
If you are worried the threat might be real, do not use the phone numbers they provide. Look up the official number of the local police station or the agency they claimed to represent on Google. Call that number on a separate line. You will invariably be told that no such officer exists and no such case number is registered.

#### Step 3: Cyber-crime reporting
If you shared any personal details, immediately report the incident on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in) or call 1930. Even if you lost no money, your report helps the I4C (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre) map the scammer's network and block their numbers. Block the caller on your phone and WhatsApp immediately.

### Real procedure if police want to contact you

- You receive a written notice (summons) delivered in person or by post
- The notice has a case number and specifies date/time to appear
- No payment is ever demanded
- You have the right to consult a lawyer

## 3. UPI and payment fraud

### 3.1. The mechanics of UPI scams

#### The "Collect Request" Trap
This relies on the victim's misunderstanding of how UPI works. Scammers send a "Collect Request" but phrase it as a "Refund" or "Cashback" approval. The app screen shows a "Pay" button, but the scammer insists, "Sir, this is to receive money, just enter your PIN to authorise the credit." **Rule of Life**: You never, ever need to enter your UPI PIN to *receive* money. If you are entering a PIN, money is leaving your account.

#### The "QR Code" Reversal
Similar to the collect request, the scammer sends a QR code via WhatsApp, claiming "Scan this to receive payment for your OLX item." Scanning a QR code is exclusively a payment action. By scanning and entering your PIN, you are paying the scammer, not receiving funds. This is prevalent in online marketplaces like OLX and Quikr.

#### Screen sharing weaponization
Scammers often pose as "Customer Support" and ask you to install "support apps" like AnyDesk, TeamViewer, or RustDesk. Once installed, they ask you to grant permissions. Now they can see your screen. They will ask you to open your payment app "to check the refund status." As you enter your PIN, they watch the screen (or the blacked-out overlay) and record the keystrokes, or simply initiate the transaction themselves while you watch helplessly.

### 3.2. Defence protocol for digital payments

#### Action 1: The "PIN Protocol"
Establish a hard rule for yourself and family members: The UPI PIN is *only* for sending money. If anyone tells you to enter a PIN to receive a prize, refund, or government subsidy, they are lying. There are no exceptions to this technical rule.

#### Action 2: App isolation
Never install remote access tools (AnyDesk, TeamViewer) at the behest of a caller. If you have these apps for legitimate work, ensure they are fully closed when performing banking transactions. Android and iOS now provide indicators (green/orange dots) when a screen is being shared or recorded; learn to recognise these warnings.

#### Action 3: Transaction limits as safety brakes
Configure your UPI app (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm) with a daily transaction limit that matches your actual usage (e.g., ₹2,000 for daily expenses). If a scammer attempts to drain ₹50,000, the bank's hard limit will block the transaction, turning a disaster into a minor nuisance. Enable SMS and email alerts for every transaction, no matter how small, to detect "testing" transactions by fraudsters.

## 4. Fake customer care numbers: The Search Engine Trap

### 4.1. SEO Manipulation and Paid Ad Fraud
Fraudsters use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to push fake customer care numbers to the top of Google search results for popular Indian services like Swiggy, Zomato, SBI, or Amazon. They often buy Google Ads that appear as the first result, featuring a mobile number (e.g., +91-XXXXX...) as the "Official Helpline." Because users trust the first result they see during a moment of frustration (like a missing refund), they call these numbers without verification, walking straight into a social engineering trap.

### 4.2. The Remote Access Escalation
Once you call a fake helpline, the "Agent" speaks professionally and acknowledges your problem (e.g., "Yes sir, your refund of ₹500 is pending"). They then claim that to process the refund, they need to "verify your device." They instruct you to download a remote-access app like AnyDesk, TeamViewer, or RustDesk. The moment you grant them permissions, they can see your screen, including your banking passwords and OTPs as they arrive, allowing them to drain your account while pretending to fix your issue.

### 4.3. Legitimate Customer Care Protocol
Legitimate companies in India will never ask you to install a third-party remote access app to resolve a refund or delivery issue. Official support is typically handled through the app's internal chat interface or a verified "short-code" number. If you need a helpline, always go to the "Contact Us" section within the official app itself, rather than searching on Google or Google Maps, where data is easily manipulated by external actors.

## 5. Job and work-from-home scams: The "Easy Money" Lure

### 5.1. The Task-Based "Like and Earn" Fraud
This scam targets the desire for flexible income. Victims are recruited via Telegram or WhatsApp and given simple tasks, such as "Liking" YouTube videos or rating hotels on Google Maps for ₹50 per task. Initially, the scammers pay out small amounts (₹200-500) to build trust. This is the "Hook." They then invite the victim to join a "VIP Group" where they must "invest" a larger sum (e.g., ₹5,000) to unlock higher-paying tasks, promising a 30% profit within an hour.

### 5.2. The Advance Fee and Training Scam
Classic job fraud involves impersonating well-known Indian corporations like Tata, Reliance, or Infosys. The victim receives a professional-looking "Offer Letter" via email (usually from a Gmail/Yahoo address). The catch is a demand for a "Laptop Security Deposit," "Registration Fee," or "Mandatory Training Kit Fee." The scammers claim this is refundable with the first salary. Once the payment is made via UPI, the "HR Manager" deletes their account and vanishes.

### 5.3. Identifying Fraudulent Employment Offers
A legitimate employer in India will never charge a candidate any fee for recruitment, training, or equipment as a condition of employment. Corporate recruiters use official company email domains (e.g., @tata.com), not free webmail services. If an offer comes without a formal interview process and promises an unrealistic salary for unskilled work (e.g., ₹5,000 per day for data entry), it is a statistical certainty that the offer is a scam designed to extract an upfront payment.

## 6. Investment and trading scams: The "Get Rich Quick" Mirage

### 6.1. Stock Market "Insider" Groups
Fraudsters create large WhatsApp and Telegram groups, often impersonating well-known Indian financial influencers or brokerage firms like Zerodha or Groww. They provide "Daily Tips" that initially seem to work, leading victims to believe they have access to privileged information. Once the victim is hooked, they are pressured to invest large sums into a custom-built, fake trading app that shows fictional profits. When the victim tries to withdraw their money, the app claims they must first pay a "Tax" or "Security Fee," leading to further losses.

### 6.2. The "Pig Butchering" (Sha Zhu Pan) Strategy
This is a long-term psychological scam where the fraudster builds a romantic or professional relationship with the victim over several weeks. The term "Pig Butchering" refers to "fattening up" the victim with affection and small investment wins before the final "slaughter" where the fraudster disappears with the victim's life savings. In India, these often start on dating apps or LinkedIn, transitioning to talk about a "New Crypto Opportunity" or a "Secret AI Trading Bot" that the fraudster's "Uncle" uses.

### 6.3. Verifying Legitimate Investment Platforms
In India, every legitimate stockbroker or investment advisor must be registered with **SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India)** and possess a valid CRN (Registration Number). You can verify these numbers on the official SEBI website. If a platform is not SEBI-registered and asks you to transfer money to a personal UPI ID rather than a corporate "Escrow Account," it is a fraudulent entity. No legitimate investment guarantees a "Fixed 10% Daily Return"; such promises are the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.

## 7. OTP and SIM swap fraud: The Identity Hijack

### 7.1. Social Engineering for OTPs
Fraudsters often call posing as "Bank Security" or "Telecom Support," claiming that your account is about to be blocked or your KYC has expired. They create a sense of extreme urgency to bypass your critical thinking. They will tell you, "I am sending a verification code, please read it back to me to stop the block." This code is actually the **OTP** required to authorize a high-value transfer or to reset your net-banking password. Once shared, your account is drained in seconds.

### 7.2. The SIM Swap Attack
This is a more technical attack where the fraudster first gathers your personal details (Aadhaar, DOB, Address) from data breaches. They then pose as you and contact your telecom provider (Jio, Airtel, Vi) to report a "Lost SIM." A new SIM card is issued to the fraudster, and your physical phone suddenly shows **"No Network."** Because the fraudster now has your phone number, they can receive all your banking OTPs and bypass 2-Factor Authentication, allowing them to take over your entire digital life while your phone is offline.

### 7.3. Indicators and Defence Protocols
The most immediate indicator of a SIM swap is the sudden, unexplained loss of cellular signal in a location where you normally have full bars. If your phone shows "Emergency Calls Only" or "No Service" for more than 15 minutes, do not wait for it to "fix itself." Immediately call your bank from a landline or a family member's phone to freeze your accounts. Additionally, enable a **"SIM Lock PIN"** through your phone settings; this requires a 4-digit code to activate the SIM, preventing a fraudster from using a cloned card even if they successfully obtain one.

## 8. Romance and matrimonial scams: The Heartbreak Heist

### 8.1. The "Slow Burn" Relationship Building
Scammers create highly attractive profiles on Indian matrimonial sites (Shaadi.com, Jeevansathi) or dating apps. Unlike other scams, this is a "Slow Burn" that can last for months. The fraudster invests time in daily calls, video chats (using "Deepfake" or recorded loops), and emotional intimacy to make the victim feel they have found their life partner. Once the emotional hook is set, a "Crisis" inevitably occurs—an accident, a business loss, or a custom seizure of a "Gift" they sent to the victim.

### 8.2. The "Emergency Extraction" Phase
The fraudster requests money not as a loan, but as a "Life-Saving Favor." They might claim to be an NRI doctor stuck at an airport with a baggage issue or a soldier in a remote area with a blocked bank account. Because the victim is emotionally committed, they bypass their usual skepticism and transfer large sums. The requests then become repetitive—each payment leading to another "Unexpected Hurdle" that requires just one more transfer to resolve.

### 8.3. Defence and Red Flags
The primary red flag is any individual who avoids meeting in person for an extended period, citing professional or distance constraints. Be extremely wary of someone who professes intense love within days of meeting online. We recommend performing a **"Reverse Image Search"** on their profile photos to see if they are stolen from a minor celebrity or a foreign model. Never send money to someone you have not met in person, regardless of the emotional pressure or the supposed urgency of their situation.

## 11. What to do if you've been scammed: The Recovery Protocol

### 11.1. The "Golden Hour" Response (1930 Helpline)
If you realize you have been scammed, the first 60 minutes are the **"Golden Hour."** You must immediately dial **1930** (The National Cyber Crime Helpline). This connects you to the I4C command center, which has the power to "Freeze" the recipient's bank account or UPI ID across the Indian banking network. If the money is frozen before the scammer can withdraw it at an ATM or move it to a mule account, your chances of recovery are significantly higher.

### 11.2. Formal Reporting at cybercrime.gov.in
Calling 1930 is the first step, but it must be followed by a formal complaint on the **National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal**. This portal creates a legal "Acknowledgment Number" that is required by banks to process a chargeback and by insurance companies for claims. You will need to upload screenshots of the conversation, the payment receipt (UTR number), and the scammer's phone number. This digital record is essential for the police to convert your complaint into an FIR (First Information Report).

### 11.3. Banking and Credit Protection
Contact your bank's 24/7 fraud helpline immediately to block your debit/credit cards and net-banking access. If you believe your identity (Aadhaar/PAN) has been stolen, you should also contact **CIBIL** or other credit bureaus to place a "Fraud Alert" on your profile. This prevents the scammers from using your documents to take out fraudulent loans in your name. Beware of **"Secondary Scams"**—online agents who promise to recover your money for an upfront fee are almost always fraudsters targeting previous victims.

## 9. Courier and customs scams (The "FedEx" Trap)

### 9.1. The "Narcotics in Parcel" Narrative
The scam usually begins with an IVR (automated) call: "This is FedEx/DHL. Your parcel has been returned. Press 9." Once connected, the "agent" claims a parcel sent *by you* to Taiwan or Dubai has been intercepted. They allege it contains 5 passports, 2kg of MDMA (drugs), or laptops. The shock of being accused of international drug trafficking puts the victim into immediate panic mode.

### 9.2. The "Fake Customs" Handoff
The agent then "transfers" the call to the "Narcotics Control Bureau" or "Mumbai Customs." A new voice, often aggressive and authoritative, takes over. They may share a fake ID badge on WhatsApp. They claim an FIR is being filed and an arrest warrant issued. The only way to avoid immediate arrest, they claim, is to pay a "Refundable Security Deposit" to verify your bank account is not used for money laundering.

### 9.3. Defence Protocol: The "Tracking Number" Test
Real logistics companies never call to demand money or threaten arrest. If a parcel is seized, you receive a written notice.
*   **The Check**: Ask for the "Airway Bill Number" (AWB). Hang up. Go to the official FedEx/DHL website (not a link they send) and track it. It will not exist.
*   **The Payment Rule**: Customs duties are paid to government accounts (via the ICEGATE portal), never to personal UPI IDs or private bank accounts. If you are asked to Google Pay a "Customs Officer," it is 100% a scam.

## 10. Universal defence principles

### 10.1. The "5-Second Stop" Rule
Scammers rely on "System 1" thinking (fast, emotional). To defeat them, you must engage "System 2" (slow, logical). When you receive a threatening call, force yourself to wait 5 seconds before responding. Take a breath. This micro-pause breaks the "Urgency Spell" and allows your logical brain to ask: "Why is the Police Commissioner video calling me on WhatsApp?"

### 10.2. The "Zero Trust" Architecture for Communications
Adopt a "Zero Trust" policy for incoming unsolicited contact.
*   **Caller ID Spoofing**: Scammers can make it look like the call is coming from "+91 22 2262..." (Mumbai Police). Never trust Caller ID.
*   **Callback Verification**: Hang up. Find the official number of the organization from their public website. Call *that* number. The scammer cannot intercept an outbound call you make to a legitimate line.

### 10.3. Digital Hygiene as a Vaccine
Prevention is cheaper than recovery.
*   **DND Registration**: Register on the TRAI DND (Do Not Disturb) list to reduce spam, making scam calls stand out more.
*   **Limits**: Set your UPI daily transaction limit to ₹5,000 for your primary phone app. If a scammer pressures you to "pay ₹50,000 now," the system physically prevents you from complying, saving you from a life-changing loss.
