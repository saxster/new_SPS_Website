## 1. What this scam is (plain language)
"Digital arrest" is a scam in which fraudsters impersonate law enforcement or regulators on a video call and claim the victim is linked to a serious crime. Victims are told to stay on camera, avoid speaking to anyone, and transfer money for "verification." Indian cybercrime authorities have warned that these calls are fake and should be reported immediately. The national helpline for cyber financial frauds is 1930 and complaints can be filed at the national reporting portal.

## 2. Why it works
The scam exploits three human vulnerabilities:
- **Authority**: The caller claims to be police, CBI, or customs.
- **Urgency**: The victim is told action must be taken "now" to avoid arrest.
- **Isolation**: The victim is instructed not to contact family or anyone else.

## 3. Reported pattern of attack: The script of coercion

### 3.1. The "Initial Hook" (Phishing or SMS)
The attack almost always begins with a phone call or a message claiming that an international parcel in the victim's name (often from "FedEx" or "DHL") has been seized by customs. The caller claims the parcel contains illegal narcotics (MDMA) or forged passports. This "Shock and Awe" tactic is designed to put the victim's brain into "Fight or Flight" mode, bypassing their critical thinking.

### 3.2. Escalation to "Official" Interrogation
Once the victim is panicked, the call is "transferred" to a "senior officer" via video (WhatsApp/Skype). The fraudster appears in a fake police uniform with a staged office background. They show a "Case File" with the victim's Aadhaar photo (obtained from previous data leaks). They claim that the parcel is linked to a massive money-laundering network and that the victim is about to be arrested.

### 3.3. Isolation and the "Digital Arrest"
This is the most critical phase. The fraudsters tell the victim they are under "Digital Arrest." They are ordered to keep their camera on at all times, even while sleeping or using the washroom. They are forbidden from contacting their spouse, children, or lawyer, claiming that doing so would "complicate the national security investigation." This isolation is a classic interrogation tactic designed to make the victim entirely dependent on the fraudster for a "solution."

### 3.4. The "Verification" Transfer
Finally, the fraudster offers a way out. They tell the victim to transfer their entire bank balance to a "Government Verification Account" or "RBI Reserve Account." They claim the money will be "verified" for its source and returned within 30 minutes once the victim's name is cleared. Once the transfer is made via UPI or IMPS, the fraudsters vanish, and the "police officer" disappears from the video call.

## 4. Observable indicators for families and guards

### 4.1. Prolonged, unusual video call engagement
The most glaring sign is a family member (often an elder) who has been on a video call for hours and refuses to hang up. They may be carrying their phone into every room. If you see someone in your household or a resident in your society who is "stuck" on a call with their camera on, behaving with visible anxiety, it is a primary indicator of a "Digital Arrest" in progress.

### 4.2. Sudden secrecy and "Lockdown" behaviour
If a normally open family member suddenly locks themselves in a room, refuses to open the door, and won't explain what is happening, they are likely under the "Secrecy Spell" of the fraudster. They may mention that they are "helping with an investigation" or that they "cannot talk right now" in a panicked tone.

### 4.3. Agitation and repetitive checking
Look for physical signs of "Cortisol Overload"—pacing, sweating, trembling, and a desperate focus on the phone screen. They may be frantically searching for their chequebook, net-banking passwords, or Aadhaar card. This "Financial Panic" is the final stage before the money is transferred.

## 5. Immediate response protocol: Breaking the spell

### 5.1. Breaking the psychological isolation
If you suspect a "Digital Arrest," do not be polite. Force your way into the room. Physically take the phone from the victim or cover the camera lens. The fraudster will scream that you are "interfering with an official investigation"—ignore them. The moment the victim sees a real, trusted face, the "Interrogator's Spell" begins to break. Hang up the call immediately.

### 5.2. Independent verification and "The Reality Check"
Once the call is ended, sit the victim down. Call the actual local police station or a trusted family friend who is a lawyer. Explain that no Indian agency (CBI, ED, Police) has the power to "arrest" someone via video call. This "Reality Check" is essential to calm the victim's nervous system and prevent them from trying to call the fraudster back.

### 5.3. The 1930 "Golden Hour" Report
If any money has already been transferred, every second counts. Call **1930** immediately. This is the National Cyber Crime Helpline. They have a direct link to the banks' "Fraud Desk." If the report is made within the "Golden Hour" (the first 60 minutes), the bank can often "Freeze" the recipient's account, preventing the fraudster from withdrawing the cash at an ATM.

## 6. Longer-term safeguards: Building the family shield

### 6.1. The "Family Safe-Word" Rule
Establish a secret word or phrase that only your family knows (e.g., "Blue Elephant"). If anyone calls claiming an emergency or an "arrest," the first thing the family member should ask is, "What is the safe-word?" If the caller doesn't know it, it is a scam. This is the only defense against modern "AI Voice Cloning" scams.

### 6.2. Transaction alerts and "Small Wallets"
Set up your elders' banking with strict daily UPI limits (e.g., ₹2,000). Keep the bulk of their savings in a "MFA-Hardened" account that requires your secondary approval for any transfer over ₹10,000. This "Two-Key" system ensures that even if they are manipulated, the total loss is capped at a manageable amount.

### 6.3. Guard and Staff Training
In gated communities, train the security guards to recognize "Distress Patterns." If a resident is seen at the gate frantically trying to explain they need to go to the bank for an "investigation," the guard should have the protocol to call the RWA office or the resident's emergency contact. Guards are the "Human Sensors" on the ground who can prevent a scam before the victim leaves the premises.
