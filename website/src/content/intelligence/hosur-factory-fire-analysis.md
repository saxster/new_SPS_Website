## The Signal
A major fire broke out at a Tier-1 supplier factory in Hosur yesterday. Preliminary reports suggest short circuit in the chemical storage yard.

## Strategic Analysis (The "So What?")
The incident at Hosur, Tamil Nadu is not isolated. It follows a pattern of Chemical storage mismanagement seen in Q3. The immediate impact is supply chain delay, but the secondary impact is a rise in insurance premiums.

## The Hidden Risk (Regulatory & Legal)
The thesis misses the legal liability. Under Factories Act 1948, PSARA 2005, the facility manager is personally liable. This is not just an insurance issue; it is a criminal negligence risk.

## SPS Recommendation
1. **Immediate**: Audit compliance against Factories Act 1948, PSARA 2005.
2. **Medium Term**: Review liability coverage for 'Managerial Negligence'.
