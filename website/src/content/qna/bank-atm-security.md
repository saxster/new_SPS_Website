## The Direct Answer

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates a strict "Minimum Standards of Security" framework for banks and Cash-in-Transit (CIT) agencies. Key requirements include **grouting the ATM to the floor**, ensuring **no hidden cameras** can capture PINs, and using **GPS-enabled armored cash vans** with a minimum 5-person crew (Driver + 2 Guards + 2 Custodians). The **"Cassette Swap"** method is now mandatory, prohibiting open cash replenishment at ATM sites.

## Detailed Explanation

RBI's directives aim to mitigate physical attacks (gas cutters, lifting) and logical attacks (skimming) through a "Defense in Depth" strategy.

### 1. ATM Site Infrastructure and Grouting
The primary physical threat is the "ATM Lift"—where a gang uses a crane or a vehicle to rip the machine out of its housing. To counter this, RBI mandates that the ATM machine must be **grouted (bolted) to the floor** using high-tensile anchors. A compliant installation should not move even when subjected to significant force. Furthermore, the vestibule must be well-lit to deter lurking attackers and must feature "E-Surveillance" sensors (vibration, heat, and door-contact) that trigger a central alarm if an attack begins.

### 2. Cash Van (CIT) Armoured Standards
Cash-in-Transit (CIT) is a high-risk operation. The RBI and MHA guidelines require that the cash van meet specific **Ballistic Resistance** standards. The crew is a non-negotiable five-person unit: **1 Driver** (police verified), **2 Armed Guards** (carrying valid gun licenses and 12-bore DBBL weapons), and **2 Custodians** responsible for the cash cassettes. The van must be GPS-enabled, and the route must be "Randomized"—following a predictable daily pattern is the most common cause of high-value robberies.

### 3. The "Cassette Swap" Mandate
The most significant recent regulatory shift is the mandatory **"Cassette Swap"** method. In the old model, custodians opened the ATM safe in public to stuff loose cash into trays, exposing the money and the staff to high risk. In the "Cassette Swap" model, the safe is opened only to remove the empty, locked cassettes and replace them with pre-filled, locked ones from the van. This reduces the "Site Exposure Time" by 70% and ensures that the cash is never physically exposed in the vestibule.

## Compliance Audit Guide

### 4. Verifying Grouting and Physical Integrity
A simple but effective audit step is to physically attempt to shake the ATM. If there is any movement, the anchors are either loose or non-existent, making the site non-compliant and vulnerable to a lifting attack. Check the area around the base for the tell-tale signs of floor drilling and heavy-duty bolting.

### 5. Camera Angle and Privacy Shielding
The CCTV configuration must be a delicate balance. The "Customer Face Camera" must be positioned to capture a clear, high-resolution image of the user's face. However, the "Area Camera" must be audited to ensure it **explicitly blocks the view of the keypad**. If the camera can record the finger movements of a customer entering their PIN, it is a critical security and compliance failure that facilitates skimming fraud.

### 6. Cash Van and Timing Discipline
MHA notifications establish strict "Curfew Hours" for cash movement: before 9 PM in urban areas and 6 PM in rural areas. Any cash movement after these hours is a violation of the "Model Rules for Cash Logistics" and will likely void the bank's insurance policy. Audit your CIT agency's logs to ensure they aren't "cutting corners" on timing to maximize their daily trips.
