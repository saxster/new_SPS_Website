## The Direct Answer

There is no single "Hospital CCTV Act", but a confluence of guidelines sets the standard. Generally, **30 days** is the minimum retention period for general areas (lobby, corridors). However, for sensitive areas like **Emergency Rooms (ER/Casualty)** and areas handling **Medico-Legal Cases (MLC)**, footage should be retained for **90 days to 1 year**. In specific MLC cases, the relevant footage must be preserved **indefinitely** (archived separately) until the case is closed by the court. **NABH** accreditation also requires a defined, documented retention policy.

## Detailed Explanation

Indian hospitals are high-conflict environments where "Violence Against Doctors" and "Medical Negligence Claims" are recurring threats. In this context, CCTV footage is not just for security—it is your primary **Legal Defense Shield**.

### 1. Zone-Based Retention and the "Conflict Profile"
We recommend a tiered retention policy based on the risk profile of each area. For **General Areas** like the parking lot and lobby, 30 days is the industry standard, providing enough time to investigate minor thefts or vehicle damage. However, for **High-Conflict Zones** like the Emergency Room (ER), Casualty, and Billing Desks, the retention should be increased to **90 days**. These areas are the flashpoints for aggressive behavior, and legal notices for negligence often arrive weeks after the patient is discharged.

### 2. Medico-Legal Case (MLC) Preservation
For any patient admitted as an MLC (e.g., road accidents, assaults, poisoning), the standard retention rules are suspended. Any footage related to the arrival, triage, and treatment of an MLC patient should be **permanently archived** in a separate, secure "Evidence Folder." Under the Indian Evidence Act, this footage must be accompanied by a **Section 65B Certificate** to be admissible in court. If the hospital overwrites this footage after 30 days, it can be interpreted by the court as "Destruction of Evidence."

### 3. Managing Section 91 CrPC/BNSS Notices
When the police investigate a crime, they may issue a notice under **Section 91 of the CrPC** (now BNSS) demanding "Production of Documents or Things," which includes CCTV footage. The hospital's Security Officer must have a formal SOP for this: (a) Verify the officer's ID, (b) Record the exact timestamp of the clip provided, and (c) Ensure the clip is copied to an encrypted drive. Never provide the original hard drive or entire NVR to the police unless they have a court warrant, as it disrupts the safety of the rest of the hospital.

### 4. Storage Architecture and Spec-Drift
A common operational failure is "Spec-Drift"—where a system designed for 30 days of retention only delivers 22 days because new high-resolution cameras were added without upgrading the storage. We mandate a **20% Storage Buffer**. If you need 30 days of 1080p footage for 50 cameras, you require approximately 25-30 TB of usable space. You must perform a "Retention Audit" every quarter to verify that the NVR is not auto-deleting footage earlier than the policy mandates.

### 5. Privacy Signage and Patient Dignity
While recording is necessary, hospitals must navigate the "Right to Privacy." You must display clear **Signage** ("You are under CCTV surveillance") at every entrance. Crucially, cameras must be audited to ensure they do not overlook patient beds or inside changing rooms/washrooms. In the Operating Theater (OT), if recording is done for educational or safety purposes, it must be declared in the patient's "Informed Consent" form. Access to this highly sensitive OT footage must be restricted to the Medical Superintendent via a biometric-locked terminal.
