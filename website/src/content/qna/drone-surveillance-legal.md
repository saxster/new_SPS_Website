## The Direct Answer

**Yes**, drone surveillance is legal for private security, but strictly regulated under the **Drone Rules, 2021**. You must possess a **Remote Pilot Certificate**, register the drone on the **Digital Sky Platform**, and operate only within **Green Zones**. Flying in Red Zones (near airports, military bases) or Yellow Zones without ATC permission is a criminal offence. You cannot fly over public property or neighbours' private property without consent (privacy violation).

## Detailed Explanation

Drones are a significant force multiplier for private security, especially for monitoring large perimeters such as solar parks, industrial estates, and gated townships. However, the legal framework is strict.

### 1. Unique Identification and Registration (UIN)
Under the **Drone Rules 2021**, every drone weighing more than 250 grams (Small, Medium, and Large categories) must be registered on the DGCA's **Digital Sky Platform**. This process generates a **Unique Identification Number (UIN)**, which is the digital equivalent of a vehicle's license plate. Operating a commercial drone without a UIN is a punishable offense. The UIN must be physically embossed on the drone's chassis and encoded into its flight controller firmware to ensure traceability.

### 2. Remote Pilot Certification and Training
Owning a drone does not grant the right to fly it for commercial security purposes. The operator must possess a valid **Remote Pilot Certificate (RPC)** issued by a DGCA-approved Remote Pilot Training Organization (RPTO). This certification involves rigorous training on air law, flight principles, and emergency procedures. For private security agencies (PSAs), this means their guards cannot simply "pick up a controller"; they must be certified pilots, or the agency must hire professional external pilots.

### 3. The Digital Sky Map: Red, Yellow, and Green Zones
The most critical operational constraint is the **Interactive Airspace Map** on the Digital Sky portal. 
*   **Green Zones**: Areas up to 400 feet (120 meters) above ground level where no flight permission is required (though UIN and RPC rules still apply).
*   **Yellow Zones**: Controlled airspace near airports or sensitive areas where automated or manual permission from Air Traffic Control (ATC) is mandatory.
*   **Red Zones**: Strictly prohibited areas (e.g., Rashtrapati Bhavan, nuclear plants, and international borders) where flying a private drone is a criminal act under the Aircraft Act.

## Pilot and Operational Protocols

### 4. Mandatory Third-Party Insurance
Commercial drone operations for security surveillance require a mandatory **Third-Party Liability Insurance** policy. This protects the organization against claims if the drone crashes and causes injury to a person or damage to third-party property (e.g., hitting a resident's car in a township). Operating without insurance is a direct violation of the 2021 Rules and exposes the organization to massive civil and criminal liability.

### 5. Privacy Constraints and "No-Fly" Peeking
While the drone is legally in the air, its "eyes" are restricted. You cannot use a security drone to record footage of public roads, adjacent government buildings, or the private balconies/interiors of neighbouring residents. Doing so constitutes a **Violation of Privacy** and "Harassment," which can lead to lawsuits and the seizure of the drone by local police. We recommend configuring "Privacy Masks" in the drone's software to automatically black out areas outside the site's boundary.

### 6. The Flight Log and Audit Trail
Every flight must be recorded in a **Digital Flight Log Book**. This log must include the time of takeoff, the pilot's RPC number, the purpose of the flight (e.g., "Night Perimeter Patrol"), and the landing time. In the event of an incident or a police inquiry, this logbook is your primary legal defense to prove that the operation was conducted within the authorized zone and by a qualified pilot. For nano-drones (<250g), while the RPC is not required, the zone and privacy rules still apply in full.
