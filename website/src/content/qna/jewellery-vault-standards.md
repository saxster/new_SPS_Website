## The Direct Answer

Security for jewellery businesses revolves around the **Strong Room (Vault)**. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specifies **IS 15369:2003** for strong room doors and **IS 550** for safes. A compliant vault must have **Class-AA or Class-A doors** (oxy-acetylene torch resistant), reinforced concrete walls (minimum 300mm), and time-lock mechanisms. Insurance policies ("Jewellers Block Policy") are often void if these standards are not met.

## Detailed Explanation

Jewellery heists in India have transitioned from "Smash and Grab" to highly sophisticated "Mechanical Breach" attacks, including tunneling from adjacent properties and the use of oxy-acetylene torches.

### 1. The Strong Room (The Fortress Core)
The Strong Room is the single most important security investment for a jeweller. Following **IS 15369**, the walls must be constructed of Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) with a minimum grade of M40 and a thickness of 300mm to 450mm. The concrete must be reinforced with a "Tangbar" or a double-mesh of TMT bars to resist drilling. The door itself must be **Class-AA**, meaning it is specifically designed to resist oxy-acetylene torch attacks and explosives for a duration defined by the BIS rating. Air vents must be "Z-shaped" to prevent intruders from inserting rods or liquid explosives through the ventilation system.

### 2. The Active Showroom Floor
Showroom security focuses on the "First 60 Seconds" of a robbery. We recommend the installation of **Fogging Systems** (Smoke Cloaks). When a panic button is pressed, the room fills with a dense, non-toxic fog in under 10 seconds, reducing visibility to less than 30 centimeters. If the robbers cannot see the inventory or the exit, the robbery is effectively neutralized. Additionally, the main entrance should feature a **Mantrap (Interlocking Door)** system, ensuring that the outer door must be closed and locked before the inner door can be opened, preventing a quick getaway.

## Operational and Technical Controls

### 3. Vibration and Seismic Monitoring
Inside a vault, standard motion sensors (PIR) are insufficient because they only trigger once the wall is already breached. We mandate the installation of **Seismic Vibration Sensors** on all six surfaces of the vault (including the floor and ceiling). These sensors are calibrated to detect the high-frequency vibrations of a diamond-tip drill or a jackhammer, providing an alert while the intruders are still on the *other* side of the wall. This gives the local police or QRT the critical 10-minute window needed to arrive before the assets are reached.

### 4. The "Two-Key" and Time-Lock Protocol
Physical security is only as strong as the "Key Management." We implement a strict **Two-Key Rule**, where the vault can only be opened by the simultaneous presence of two distinct individuals (e.g., the Manager and the Accountant). Furthermore, all Class-AA doors must be equipped with a **Mechanical Time-Lock**. This clock physically blocks the bolt-work of the door during non-business hours (e.g., from 8 PM to 10 AM). Even if a manager is taken hostage at their home, they literally *cannot* open the vault until the pre-set time, neutralizing the "Hostage Threat" vector.

### 5. CCTV Forensics and street visibility
For jewellery showrooms, the CCTV retention policy must be **90 days minimum**. Most sophisticated heists involve a "Recce" (reconnaissance) phase that happens weeks before the attack; 30 days of footage is rarely enough to trace the perpetrators' earlier visits. Regarding street visibility, we advise a "Hybrid Profile": while the vault should be hidden from general view, the corridor leading to it should be well-lit and visible to cameras, creating a "Stage" that makes any unauthorized movement highly visible to the 24/7 Command Centre.
