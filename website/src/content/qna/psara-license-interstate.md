## The Direct Answer

**No.** A license issued under the **Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (PSARA)** is location-specific. It is valid **only** for the jurisdiction of the Controlling Authority (usually the State Home Department) that issued it. A license obtained in Karnataka is invalid in Maharashtra. Security agencies operating in multiple states must apply for a separate PSARA license in **every single state** (and often specific districts) where they deploy guards.

## Detailed Explanation

The misconception that a PSARA license is "National" arises because it is a *Central Act* passed by Parliament. However, the operational reality is that the Act delegates all licensing and enforcement powers to the **State Governments**. Each state Home Department acts as the "Controlling Authority," framing its own specific rules (e.g., the Delhi Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Rules, 2009) that govern training, uniform patterns, and supervisor-to-guard ratios.

### 1. The Jurisdiction Hierarchy and District Limits
A PSARA license is a tiered document. You must apply for a **District License** if you only operate in one city, or a **State License** for the entire state. Crucially, even within a state, some Home Departments require you to "Notify" them of every new district where you begin operations. There is absolutely no provision for "Cross-Border Recognition." If your agency is registered in Karnataka but takes a contract in Maharashtra, they are legally considered an "unlicensed entity" the moment their guards cross the state border.

### 2. Criminal and Civil Liabilities of Interstate Violations
Deploying guards without a local license is not just a regulatory lapse; it is a **Non-Bailable Criminal Offence** under Section 20 of the Act. The local police can file an FIR against the agency's directors. More importantly for the client, the **Principal Employer** can be charged with "Abetment" for hiring an unlicensed service. In the event of a theft or a major accident on your site, insurance providers will routinely reject claims if the security provider was not legally authorized to operate in that specific jurisdiction.

## Vendor Due Diligence Framework

### 3. Auditing the "State-Specific" Documentation
The primary step in vendor vetting is to demand the *State-Specific* PSARA registration certificate, not just the Head Office copy. You must verify the "Valid Thru" date and ensure the address on the license matches the agency's local operations. PSARA licenses are generally valid for 5 years, but the agency must initiate the renewal process 90 days before expiry. If they are in the "Renewal Phase," demand the government-stamped acknowledgement of the renewal application.

### 4. The Physical Office and Infrastructure Check
To obtain a license in a new state, PSARA rules mandate that the agency must maintain a **Physical Local Office** in that jurisdiction. This is to ensure that the Controlling Authority can conduct audits and that the local police can reach the management during an incident. As a client, you should perform a "Physical Site Visit" to this office. If the "Local Office" is just a residential apartment or a virtual address, the agency is likely in violation of the state's infrastructure norms and their license could be cancelled at any time.

### 5. Compliance with the Interstate Migrant Workmen Act
If an agency moves a batch of trained guards from Uttar Pradesh to a factory in Tamil Nadu, they must comply with the **Interstate Migrant Workmen Act, 1979**, in addition to PSARA. This requires registration with the Labour Department and ensures specific welfare standards for the guards. Failing to manage this secondary layer of compliance often leads to labour unrest and "Strike Risk," which can disrupt your site's security regardless of the guards' training.
